# The C Programming Language Second Edition Book Exercises

## Chapter 1. A tutorial Introduction

### Exercise 1-1. Run the "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.
### Exercise 1-2. Experiment to find out what happens when prinf's argument string contains \c, where c is some character no listed above.

### Exercie 1-3. Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.
### Exercise 1-4. Write a program to write the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table.

### Exercise 1-5. Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degress to 0.

### Exercise 1-6. Verify that the expression getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1.
### Exercise 1-7. Write the program to print the value of EOF.

### Exercise 1-8. Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.
### Exercise 1-9. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.
### Exercise 1-10. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each backspace by \b, and each backslash by \\. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way.

### Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program ? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
### Exercise 1-12. Write a program that prints its input one word per line.

### Exercise 1-13. Write a program to print a histogram of lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.
### Exercise 1-14. Write a program to print a histogram of different characters in its input.

### Exercise 1-15. Rewirte the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function for conversion.

### Exercise 1-16. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as possible of the text.
### Exercise 1-17. Write a program to print all lines that are longer than 80 characters.
### Exercise 1-18. Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.
### Exercise 1-19. Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s. Use it to write a program that reverses its input a line at a time.

### Exercise 1-20. Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter ?
### Exercise 1-21. Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for detab. When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given preference ?
### Exercise 1-22. Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before n-th column of input. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column
### Exercise 1-23. Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C comments do not nest.
### Exercise 1-24. Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unbalanced parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escpae sequences, and comments. (This program is hard if you do it in full generality).

## Chapter 2. Types, Operators, and Expressions

### Exercise 2-1. Write a program to determine the ranges of char, short, int, and long variables, both signed and unsigned, by printing appropriate values from standart headers and by direct computation. Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the various floating-point types.

### Exercise 2-2. Write a loop equivalent to the for loop above without using && or ||.

### Exercise 2-3. Write the function htoi(s), which converts a string of hexadecimal digits (including an optional 0x or 0X) into its equivalent integer value. The allowable digits are 0 through 9, a through f, and A through F.
